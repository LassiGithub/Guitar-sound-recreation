# Description

This is a jupyter notebook python project about recreating a guitar sound. The aim is to analyze a recording of a guitar, extract its overtone envelopes, and rebuild the sound using those envelopes. If all that sounds complicated, the basic idea is to deconstruct the recording into special sine waves, then reconstruct it using those special sine waves.

Libraries used: Numpy, scipy, IPython, matplotlib

More information and the code itself can be found in the 'Guitar sound recreation.ipynb' notebook file.

If you don't want to run the notebook but still want to hear the generated guitar sound, you can simply listen to the .wav files in the repo. 'Guitar 100Hz.wav' is the original, 'Synthesized guitar.wav' is the recreation.
